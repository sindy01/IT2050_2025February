Serial DTE vs Serial DCE:

1. Serial DTE (Data Terminal Equipment):

DTE refers to the device that originates or terminates data transmissions. In the context of routers, a DTE device would be the router itself.
When configuring a router's serial interface as a DTE, it means the router expects to connect to a DCE device using a serial cable.
DTE devices do not supply clocking signals; instead, they rely on the clocking provided by the connected DCE device.

2. Serial DCE (Data Communications Equipment):

DCE refers to the device that establishes, maintains, and terminates a connection between data terminal equipment (DTE) devices. In the context of routers, a DCE device could be a CSU/DSU (Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit).
DCE devices provide the clocking signal for the serial connection. This clocking signal synchronizes the data transfer between the DTE and DCE devices.


In a router-to-router connection:

If one router's serial interface is configured as DTE, then the other router's serial interface must be configured as DCE.

The DCE router typically sets the clock rate on the serial interface to establish the timing for data transmission.
